The plan for the workflow is as follows:
- get street network file in whatever format.
- convert street network to a python graph / matrix
- check if there is a eulirian path, if there is, find it.
- if there is no eulirian circuit and no semi eulirian path, remove 
    the number of nodes with odd degrees (num of edges connecting to node) - 2.
    Then calculate the path.
- after calculating the path or circuit, output this to a shapefile.
- add back in any removed nodes with one degree as points in the shapefile and connect these to the main path with an out and back line.
- convert the shp to a gpx file using https://pypi.org/project/gpx-converter/
